## Outer Joins

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, o.order_id, c.first_name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id
```

## Outer Join Between Multiple Tables

```sql
SELECT order_date, order_id, first_name, sh.name AS shipper, os.name as status
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shippers sh
ON sh.shipper_id = o.shipper_id
LEFT JOIN order_statuses os
ON o.status = os.order_status_id
ORDER BY sh.name
```

## Self Outer Joins

```sql
SELECT e.first_name AS employee, m.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m
ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
